# Initial Guidelines

Please make sure that your changes are appropriately tested with unit tests
covering each phase of translation in the compiler, and that your changes
conform to the [LLVM Coding Standards](llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst).

Also please review the feme/.instructions.md file.

When you build and test ensure that you are using object file caching, and
building with assertions enabled.

When you deviate from the design document please update the design document.

Break your changes into small code changes with each change committed
spearately. Record your thought process into a file named "agent_thoughts.md" at
the root of the repository and commit it in its own commit when you're done.

# Request

Let's start working on SPIR-V re-targeting. Rather than re-targeting to x86 as
the design document suggests can first build a null-pipeline that allows SPIRV
to convert to LLVM IR, then back to SPIRV through the LLVM SPIRV backend?
