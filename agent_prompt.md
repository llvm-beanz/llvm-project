# Initial Guidelines

Please make sure that your changes are appropriately tested with unit tests
covering each phase of translation in the compiler, and that your changes
conform to the [LLVM Coding Standards](llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst).

Also please review the feme/.instructions.md file.

When you build and test ensure that you are using object file caching, and
building with assertions enabled.

When you deviate from the design document please update the design document.

Break your changes into small code changes with each change committed
spearately. Record your thought process into a file named "agent_thoughts.md" at
the root of the repository and commit it in its own commit when you're done.

# Request

In a previous change you didn't attempt some of the things I requested.
Specifically you left this note:

## Follow-up work (not attempted here, left for later changes)

- Resource-handle DXIL opcodes (`CreateHandle`, `AnnotateHandle`, buffer/
  texture loads and stores, etc.) and the corresponding `LLVMFrontendHLSL`
  metadata reconstruction -- the part of the original request this change
  does *not* yet address, and the natural next opcode family to raise.
- SPIR-V raising to LLVM `SPIRV`-target intrinsics (today's
  `SPIRVToLLVMTranslator` only reaches the generic `llvm` dialect via
  `ConvertSPIRVToLLVMPass`).
- A `Driver`/end-user `--to=llvm` "output format" surfaced through `feme`
  itself, once enough of the above exists to make it meaningful; today the
  equivalent is composing `feme-translate --import-dxil` with `feme-opt
  --llvm -passes=feme-dxil-raise-ops` by hand.
- Using real `offload-test-suite`-compiled shaders as test collateral, once
  resource-op raising exists to make them exercise more than the "left
  untouched" path.

Can you please address those issues and ensure that the op-raising pass covers
all valid dxil ops?
